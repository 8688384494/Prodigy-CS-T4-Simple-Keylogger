Description: Keylogger

Overview:
This Python script implements a basic keylogger using the pynput library. A keylogger is a program designed to record the keystrokes typed on a keyboard covertly. In this implementation, the keylogger listens for keyboard events and records the keys pressed by the user. It then stores this information in a log file named "log.txt".

Features:

Listener Setup: The script utilizes the Listener class from the pynput.keyboard module to capture keyboard events.
Event Handling: The storedletter function is registered as the callback function to handle each key press event.
Logging: When a key is pressed, the storedletter function is called, converting the pressed key into a string format. Any single quotes in the string are removed using the replace method to prevent formatting issues in the log file.
File Writing: The cleaned key string is then appended to the "log.txt" file using the with statement to ensure proper file handling and closure after writing.
Usage:

Starting the Keylogger: The script can be executed to start the keylogger. Once running, it silently listens for keyboard events in the background.
Recording Keystrokes: As the user types on the keyboard, the keylogger captures each keystroke and writes it to the log file.
Stopping the Keylogger: The keylogger continues to run until manually stopped or terminated.
Security Considerations:

Permission: Running a keylogger without the user's consent is unethical and potentially illegal. It's essential to use such tools responsibly and only for legitimate purposes, such as debugging or parental monitoring.
Data Security: Since keyloggers can capture sensitive information like passwords and personal messages, it's crucial to secure the log files appropriately and ensure they are not accessible to unauthorized users.
Antivirus Detection: Keyloggers are often flagged by antivirus software due to their potential for misuse. If used for legitimate purposes, ensure that the keylogger's activity is not mistakenly identified as malicious by security software.
Conclusion:
This keylogger script provides a simple demonstration of how keylogging functionality can be implemented in Python. However, it's essential to use such tools responsibly and ethically, respecting user privacy and legal considerations.
